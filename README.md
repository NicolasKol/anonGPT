#anonGPT

anonGPT will be a python module to anonymize your chatgpt requests. 
Right now it's just some regex that filters some personal data. I am going to add more expressions as I go.
I will also be using https://github.com/unbiased-coder/python-extract-human-names-nltk to extrace names.

The plan is to substitute the information for dummy information so the context is not lost; do the API call and then substitute it back
