# anonGPT

anonGPT will be a python module to anonymize your chatgpt requests. 
Right now it's just some regex that filters some personal data. Decided to use ML for this task instead of regex. It's too literal for this application
I will also be using https://github.com/unbiased-coder/python-extract-human-names-nltk to extrace names.

The plan is to substitute the information for dummy information so the context is not lost; do the API call and then substitute it back
